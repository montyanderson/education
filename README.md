This repository contains a list of free, online educational resources I personally use regularly.

## Music Technology

* [Lantertronics - Aaron Lanterman](https://www.youtube.com/@Lantertronics)

Created by Georgia Tech professor Aaron Lanterman, Lantertronics is a deep series of experiments and lectures around signal processing. It's focused mostly around analogue hardware, with many academic analyses of famous musical effects and units.

* [Moritz Klein](https://www.youtube.com/@MoritzKlein0)

Moritz Klein shows you how to go about building DIY modules for modular synths. He uses practical examples to explain the workings of circuitry. Great for people a little newer to analogue signal processing.

## Economics and Finance

* [Money & Macro](https://www.youtube.com/@MoneyMacro)

Lecturer and PhD economist Joeri Schasfoort makes thoughtful, balanced, and nuanced video essays about macroeconomics and it's history. My favourite are his videos about money creation and his explaination of the 'hierarchy of money'.

* [Patrick Boyle](https://www.youtube.com/@PBoyle/videos)

Boyle is hedge-fund manager and visiting lecturer at King's College London. His videos cover the gritty complexity of financial trading and market behaviours. For getting a deeper academic understanding, his series _Applied Portfolio Management_ is great.
